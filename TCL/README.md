# STATIO: Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Simulator

This simulator is part of [STATIO](https://statio.webs.upv.es), the Educational Innovation and Improvement Project (PIME/25-26/562) developed by the DEIOAC–[Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es).

# Description
This application is an interactive simulator designed to visualize and understand the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**. It allows students and users to experiment with different parameters (such as sample size and population distribution) to observe how the sampling distribution of the sample mean converges to a Normal distribution.
